## Phase 2+ (Custom — TBD)

Phase 2 and 3 will be custom-designed based on the real Beebs Supply business story. Mappings to be determined after discussing:

- How dog treats are actually made
- What scaling looks like (home kitchen → commercial kitchen → factory → national brand)
- What story/arc to tell
- What the "endgame" looks like for a dog treat business

See the `discuss-dog-treat-business` todo for next steps.
